Project Three, Social Justice Festival
# project overview
Cantonese Rising is a multiday festival which promotes Cantonese language and culture. The festival is held in San Francisco's Chinatown which is a hub of Chinese culutre and the Cantonese language since the majority of immigrants in that area are Cantonese speakers. Events will be interactive and informative.

Being both a Cantonese and Mandarin speaker, Cantonese is very fundamental for me and for my culture as my cultural heritage is from Southeast China where Cantonese is native to that region. Whenever I am in Chinatown, Cantonese is mainly what I hear being converesed among people and it is what I speak when I am buying groceries or ordering food from restaurants. I feel that whenever I am conversing in Cantonese I feel a deeper and more personal connection with people even though they are stangers.

Articles that I have looked online and also videos that I have watched that have related around this topic have a similar message of he importance of preserving Cantonese. Although Cantonese is spoken among around 80 million people, it is nearly not as popular compared to Mandarin. There have also been a push towards the usage of Mandarin by the Chinese government in schools which pushes out regional Chinese languages. So a lot of younger generations prefer to use mandarin rather than their regional languages. 

From personal experience, when I was in middle school there were quite a few number of chinese immigrants who spoke minimal English. When they conversed with each other they mainly spoke Mandarin, however they also knew Cantonese and other native dialects as I would hear them speak Cantonese with each other very rarely. From my  experience and relating it back to the articles that I have read it really shows how younger generations are more comfortable using Mandarin than Cantonese. So I believe that preserving and promoting Cantonese is extremely important as Cantonese is just as significant to Mandarin in having its own unique characteristics which makes the language and culture special.

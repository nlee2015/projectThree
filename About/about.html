        Cantonese Rising is a three day festival which promotes 
        and celebrates the Cantonese language and culture. With the push for greater usage of Mandarin by the
        Chinese government, fears have risen that Cantonese might be a forgotton language in the future. 
        Partnering with the organization Save Cantonese, an international movement that preserves Cantonese language and culture through 
        promoting Cantonese language programs. Our festival is created to advocate for the language and culture through 
        fun and interactive actvities that can be enjoyed by everyone not just Cantonese speakers, in order to reach a wide variety of people.

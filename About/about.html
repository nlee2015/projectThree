        Cantonese Rising is a three day festival which promotes 
        and celebrates the Cantonese language and culture in the heart of San Francisco's Chinatown, the 
        city's hub of Chinese culture. With the push for greater usage of Mandarin by the
        Chinese government, fears have risen that Cantonese might be a forgotten language in the future. 
        Our mission is to advocate for the language and culture through fun and interactive actvities that can 
        be enjoyed by everyone not just Cantonese speakers but everyone.
